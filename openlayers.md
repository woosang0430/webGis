# OpenLayers

[OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) is a high-performance, feature-packed library for creating interactive maps on the web. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source on any web page. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the [BSD 2-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).

## Getting Started

```
npm install ol
```

Import just what you need for your application:

```js
import Map from "ol/Map";
import View from "ol/View";
import TileLayer from "ol/layer/Tile";
import XYZ from "ol/source/XYZ";

new Map({
  target: "map",
  layers: [
    new TileLayer({
      source: new XYZ({
        url: "https://{a-c}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
      }),
    }),
  ],
  view: new View({
    center: [0, 0],
    zoom: 2,
  }),
});
```
